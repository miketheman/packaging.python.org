Installing packages using virtualenv
====================================

This guide discusses how to install packages using :ref:`pip` and
:ref:`virtualenv`, a tool to create isolated Python environments.

.. important::
    This "how to" guide on installing packages and using :ref:`virtualenv` is
    under development. Please refer to the :ref:`virtualenv` documentation for
    details on installation and usage.


.. note:: This doc uses the term **package** to refer to a
    :term:`Distribution Package`  which is different from an :term:`Import
    Package` that which is used to import modules in your Python source code.
